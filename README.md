# CS354R-Assignment3

## Instructions:

The application is still the same one used as in the first assignment.
Simply make (or build) the assignment using the ./makeit and ./buildit commands
and run ./OgreApp afterwards.

With regards to multiplayer, simply two clients have to run the same ./OgreApp
command. Instructions on how to play the game is included in one of the CEGUI
menus dubbed "How to Play". We used the NetworkManager library to manage our
connections.

Regarding our plans last time, we managed to finish all of the goals stated.
Paul has finished integrating Bullet and collisions are exact right now. Corin
did the entirety of the networking code and Matthew has finished the entirety of
the CEGUI code as well. Compared to our performance from the last assignment, we
think that we were far more productive and efficient in our work cycle this time
around. There is little that remains to be done as of yet.
